# SignUp-API-s
This is a newsletter signup application. It prompts the user for their details which gets saved to the mailing list of newsletter and can be used to deliever accordingly. I have used the [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) API's where you can see the details of the users who have already signed up.
To set up the project :-
* Download the project folder and cd into it.
* Create a file with name `.env`
* You will need to set your own user id and API key by signing up on [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/). Once key and user id  is generated, add it in your `.env` file.
I have added a **.env_sample** file to show how to configure a .env file. But, you should add it in your **.env** file only.
* Open your terminal in your project folder and enter the following commands
```
 npm install
 node app.js
```
* Open `localhost:3000` in your browser.
